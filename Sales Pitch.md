### **Sales Pitch for Microsoft Power Platform in Abiola Manufacturing Company**  

*"Right now, your team is working harder than they shouldâ€”manually processing orders, reconciling inventory, and dealing with delays due to disconnected systems. But what if you had a fully automated, integrated system that eliminates these inefficiencies, ensuring real-time data flow and faster order fulfillment? Thatâ€™s exactly what Microsoft Power Platform can do for your business."*  

### **Understanding your Current Pain Points**
_"Weâ€™ve analyzed your operations, and hereâ€™s whatâ€™s slowing down your efficiency:"_  

- **Manual Order Processing:** Orders come via email and are manually entered, increasing the risk of errors.  
- **Data Silos:** Different departments rely on separate spreadsheets and systems, causing inconsistencies.  
- **Inventory Mismatch:** No real-time updates lead to delays, overstocking, or stockouts.  
- **Lack of Automation:** Approvals are slow, causing bottlenecks in order fulfillment.  
- **Limited Reporting:** No analytics for sales trends, customer demand, or stock movement.  

ðŸš¨ *These inefficiencies lead to lost revenue, delayed deliveries, and lower customer satisfaction.*
